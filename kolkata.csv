                                Where word ends, perception begins. Certain things in life deserve more than spoken words. Dulcet drizzles, crimson clouds over flowing river, touch of nature, whiff of happiness, taste of freedom, are only felt at heart & sensed by soul. You perceive & get carried away with the pure essence of life.It's the perfect living that brews the essence of life. And it's the Essense that brings a perfect life within your reach.
