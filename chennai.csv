                                Property is located backside of the Hasthinapuram Bus Stand with the pollutionfree locality. The only thing I expect is a genuine party and even I dont like to tell lie and to sell my flat. Due to groundwater scarcity apart from the borewell we are lending water from outside and getting stored in the sump and from there with the motor storing it in the tank. Especially in the summertime we do have a scarcity of this water however in the winter there will be sufficient water in the borewell.
